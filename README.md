# CSharpCircuitry

Welcome to the CSharpCircuitry repository! This project is aimed at providing a set of tools for designing and visualizing electronic circuitry. Think of it as an interactive bread board based in WPF/XAML.

## Overview

CSharpCircuitry is designed to facilitate the creation and simulation of electronic circuits. Whether you're a hobbyist, student, or professional engineer, this library aims to make it easier to work with circuit components and simulate their behavior.

## Features

- **Component Library**: Explore a comprehensive library of electronic components, ranging from basic resistors and capacitors to more complex integrated circuits.
  
- **Circuit Simulation**: Simulate the behavior of your circuits to understand how they will perform under different conditions.
  
- **Graphical Interface**: Visualize your circuits with a graphical interface, making it easier to design and debug.
  
- **Open Source**: CSharpCircuitry is open source, allowing you to contribute to its development and customize it to fit your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with CSharpCircuitry, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davejoshmike/CSharpCircuitry.git
1. **Explore Examples**: Check out the CircuitryRunner directory to explore how to use the project.

1. **Build and Run**: Build the solution and run the CircuitryRunner project to see CSharpCircuitry in action.

## Documentation

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing to CSharpCircuitry, please read our contribution guidelines to get started. We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

## Current TODOs
* **Console mode**: basic command line interface that allows you to create a rudimentary curcuit
* **UI mode**: WPF/XAML frontend with the ability to modify the nodes of a circut and view the properties of the nodes
* **Additional components**: Currently only basic components like buttons, buzzers and leds are supported. Would love to see this expanded to support additional electrical components.
