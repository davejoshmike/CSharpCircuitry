# CSharpCircuitry

Welcome to the CSharpCircuitry repository! This project is aimed at providing a set of tools for designing and visualizing electronic circuitry. Think of it as an interactive bread board based in WPF/XAML.

## Overview

CSharpCircuitry is designed to facilitate the creation and simulation of electronic circuits. Whether you're a hobbyist, student, or professional engineer, this library aims to make it easier to work with circuit components and simulate their behavior.

## Features

- **Component Library**: Explore a comprehensive library of electronic components, ranging from basic resistors and capacitors to more complex integrated circuits.
  
- **Circuit Simulation**: Simulate the behavior of your circuits to understand how they will perform under different conditions.
  
- **Graphical Interface**: Visualize your circuits with a graphical interface, making it easier to design and debug.
  
- **Open Source**: CSharpCircuitry is open source, allowing you to contribute to its development and customize it to fit your needs.
